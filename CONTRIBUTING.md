# Contributions Guidelines

## Where to start
Read the documentation available at the README in order to get use to the project. Communicate with the responsible in case of doubts.

## Code of Conduct

Please try to follow the Kant’s Categorical imperative “act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law” (Kant, Immanuel, (1785). Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals). Follow the code of conduct described in the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/).

## Contributing to the repository
Follow the message conventions for the commits and the Code Conventions for quality. In any case the administrator and the code reviewers will contact the developer through the Pull Request open. Remember to commit and integrate early and often to ease the integration process.

Features and bug fixes must be linked to an issue, so the first step before contributing is the **creation of an issue**. The issue can be merged back by using **Pull Requests** to master branch.

Another important thing when you are contributing to the repository is the language. Please write everything in english, comments, documentation, issues, commits and merge requests.

##	License
**IMPORTANT!** List all the third party licenses in the file THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES in order to avoid restrictions from them and readjust your implementation. We found good documentation about licenses [here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Code+Contribution+Guidelines).
